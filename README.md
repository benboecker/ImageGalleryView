# ImageGalleryView

## Description

A custom image gallery view for iOS written in Swift. It displays a range of images one at a time, swipable and with a page indicator at the bottom. The images are provided via delegate methods.

## Installation

Clone or download the repository and and manually add the file `ImageGalleryView.swift` to your project and target.

## Usage

The gallery view can be used with storyboards or be created in code. 

```
let imageGalleryFrame = CGRect(x: 40, y: 40, width: 300, height: 200)
let imageGalleryView = ImageGalleryView(frame: imageGalleryFrame)
imageGalleryView.delegate = self
self.view.addSubview(imageGalleryView)
```

Either way, the delegate must be set.

## ImageGalleryDelegate

The delegate protocol defines some required methods to implement.

`func numberOfImages(inImageGalleryView galleryView: ImageGalleryView) -> Int`

This method returns the number of images shown in the `ImageGalleryView`. It is required to be implemented by the delegate.

`func imageGalleryView(galleryView: ImageGalleryView, imageCallback callback: ImageCallback, forImageAtIndex index: Int)`

This method is responsible for telling the `ImageGalleryView` which images it should display. It does so by providing an `ImageCallback` that **must be called and passed the image by the delegate**. The delegate can determine which image to pass by looking t the passed index.

`optional func imageGalleryView(galleryView: ImageGalleryView, didTapImageAtIndex index: Int)`

This method notifies the delegate, that an image was tapped in the `ImageGalleryView`. It is an optional method that doesn't need to be implemented.
